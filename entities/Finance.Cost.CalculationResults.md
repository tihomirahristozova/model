### GetAllowedCustomPropertyValues

Gets the allowed values for the specified custom property for this entity object.              If supported the result is ordered by property value. Some property value sources do not support ordering - in that case the result is not ordered.  
_Return Type_: **Collection Of [CustomPropertyValue](../data-types.md#general.custompropertyvalue)**  
_Declaring Type_: **EntityObject**  
_Domain API Request_: **GET**

    The search text - searches by value or description. Can contain wildcard character %.  
    _Type_: string  
     _Optional_: True

  * **exactMatch**  
    If true the search text should be equal to the property value  
    _Type_: boolean  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: False  

  * **orderByDescription**  
    If true the result is ordered by Description instead of Value. Note that ordering is not always possible.  
    _Type_: boolean  
     _Optional_: True
