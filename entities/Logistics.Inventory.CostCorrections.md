## API Methods

Methods that can be invoked in public APIs.

### ChangeState

Changes the document state to the specified new state              (Inherited from [Documents](General.Documents.md))  
_Return Type_: **void**  
_Declaring Type_: **[Documents](General.Documents.md)**  
_Domain API Request_: **POST**  

**Parameters**  
  * **newState**  
    The desired new state of the document  
    _Type_: General.DocumentState  
    Enumeration of document system states  
    _Allowed Values (General.DocumentState Enum Members)_  

    | Value | Description |
    | ---- | --- |
    | New | New document, just created. Can be edited. (Stored as 0). <br /> _Model Value:_ 0 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'New' |
    | Adjustment | Document which adjusts other released documents. (Stored as 5). <br /> _Model Value:_ 5 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'Adjustment' |
    | Planned | Planned by the system for future releasing. (Stored as 10). <br /> _Model Value:_ 10 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'Planned' |
    | FirmPlanned | Planned by operator for future releasing. (Stored as 20). <br /> _Model Value:_ 20 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'FirmPlanned' |
    | Released | Released document. Changes can be applied only through adjustment documents. (Stored as 30). <br /> _Model Value:_ 30 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'Released' |
    | Completed | Work has completed. (Stored as 40). <br /> _Model Value:_ 40 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'Completed' |
    | Closed | The document is audited and closed. Adjustments are not allowed, but reopening is allowed. (Stored as 50). <br /> _Model Value:_ 50 <br /> _Domain API Value:_ 'Closed' |


  * **userStatus**

The process of changing the document state is very labor intensive and includes              validation, generation of sub-documents and some other document-specific tasks.                          The state changing process might be very time-consuming, usually ranging              from 500 to 5000 milliseconds.                          Document states usually can only be advanced to higher states, but there are              exceptions from this rule. Database settings and configuration options might affect             the allowed state changes.                          Numerous kinds of document-specific and generic exceptions can be thrown during the             process.
