### GetAllowedCustomPropertyValues

Gets the allowed values for the specified custom property for this entity object.              If supported the result is ordered by property value. Some property value sources do not support ordering - in that case the result is not ordered.  
_Return Type_: **Collection Of [CustomPropertyValue](../data-types.md#general.custompropertyvalue)**

**Parameters**  
  * **customPropertyCode**  
    The code of the custom property  
    _Type_: string  

  * **search**  
    The search text - searches by value or description. Can contain wildcard character %.  
    _Type_: string  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: null  

  * **exactMatch**  
    If true the search text should be equal to the property value  
    _Type_: boolean  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: False  

  * **orderByDescription**  
    If true the result is ordered by Description instead of Value. Note that ordering is not always possible.  
    _Type_: boolean  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: False  

  * **top**  
    The top clause - default is 10

     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: 10  

  * **skip**  
    The skip clause - default is 0  
    _Type_: int32  
     _Optional_: True  
    _Default Value_: 0  


### CreateNotification

Creates a notification a sends a real time event to the user.  
_Return Type_: **void**  
_Declaring Type_: **EntityObject**  
_Domain API Request_: **POST**  

**Parameters**  
  * **user**  
    The user.  
    _Type_: [Users](Systems.Security.Users.md)  

  * **notificationClass**  
    The notification class.  
    _Type_: string  

  * **subject**  
    The subject.  
    _Type_: string  


### CreateCopy

Duplicates the object and its child objects belonging to the same aggregate.              The duplicated objects are not saved to the data source but remain in the same transaction as the original object.  
_Return Type_: **EntityObject**  
_Declaring Type_: **EntityObject**
