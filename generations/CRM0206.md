## Business Logic

The generation is used for creating sales VAT entries from Invoices. These records contain VAT Amount and VAT Base Amount from current Invoice and are used for collecting data  for the creating of the VAT Declaration for the reporting period.

Different lines in the Invoice may have different Line Deal Types. For each of these Line Deal Type have to be created a separate VAT Entry. Therefore, at the beginning of the generation procedure, the lines of the invoice have to be divided into sets by their Deal Type. 

For each set of lines is calculated the sum of the distributed VAT amounts. The algorithm of this calculation is described below:
<br/>_Тo make the algorithm more understandable, we will introduce several auxiliary variables. The values of these variables will be used in the descriptions of the Metrics and the creation of the new document._

````
VATDealType = the LineDealType of the current set of invoice lines

VATDocumentAmountType = Invoice.EnterpriseCompany.VATDocumentAmountType
 
VATDocumentAmountCurrency = IIF(Invoice.DocumentAmounts.InputAmountCurrency is not Null, Invoice.DocumentAmounts.InputAmountCurrency Where Invoice.DocumentAmounts.DocumentAmountType = VATDocumentAmountType, Invoice.DocumentCurrency)

DealTypeAmount = SUM (Invoice.DocumentDistributedAmount/Amount) WHERE DocumentLineId = InvoiceLine DocumentAmountType=VATDocumentAmountType Group By LineDealType

DealTypeBaseAmount = SUM (Invoice.DocumentDistributedAmount/BaseAmount) WHERE DocumentLineId = InvoiceLine DocumentAmountType=VATDocumentAmountType Group By LineDealType

VATDealType = InvoiceLine.LineDealType Group By LineDealType - it is same which is used for grouping in DealTypeAmount and DealTypeBaseAmount.
````

The Document table attributes are filled in as described in [Standard Document Attributes](../reference/standard-document-attributes.md).

## Fulfillments

| Name                     | InvoiceLineToVATEnrty                                        |
| :----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parent Entity            | InvoiceLine                                                  |
| Child Entity             | VAT.Entry                                                    |
| Parent / Child Relations | Entry.ParentDocument = Invoice; Entry.DealType = DealType; Entry.RegistrationVATNumber = Invoice.Customer.RegistrationVATNumber, Entry.RegistrationNumber = Invoice.Customer.RegistrationNumber, VATEntry.ApplyDate = Invoice.ApplyDate |

## [Metrics](../reference/metrics.md)

| Fulfillment Name      |  Metric Name  |     Measurement Unit      | Parent Value       | Child Value         | New Record |
| :-------------------- | :-----------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------- | :------------------ | :--------- |
| InvoiceLineToVATEnrty |  AmountBase   | VATDocumentAmountCurrency | DealTypeAmount     | Entry.AmountBase    | YES        |
| InvoiceLineToVATEnrty | VATAmountBase | VATDocumentAmountCurrency | DealTypeBaseAmount | Entry.VATAmountBase | YES        |


**The new VAT Entries are created as follows:**
```
 
Entry.EntryType = Sales

Entry.DealType = VATDealType

Entry.Party = Invoice.Customer.Party

Entry.RegistrationNumber = 
       if Invoice.Customer.Party.PartyType = Company, then Entry.RegistrationVATNumber = Invoice.Customer.RegistrationVATNumber
           
       if (Invoice.Customer.RegistrationNumber.HasValue and Invoice.Customer.Party.PartyType = Company), then Entry.RegistrationNumber = Invoice.Customer.RegistrationNumber
        
       if Invoice.Customer.Party.PartyType = Person, then Entry.RegistrationNumber = Invoice.Customer.Party.Person.NationalNumber

Entry.ReferencedDocumentType = Invoice.DocumentType

Entry.ReferencedDocumentNo = Invoice.DocumentNo

Entry.AmountBase = CONVERT( Remaining(AmountBase), BaseCurrency)

Entry.VATAmountBase = CONVERT( Remaining(VATAmountBase), BaseCurrency)

Entry.ApplyDate = Invoice.ApplyDate

Entry.CashReportingMode = Invoice.VATCashReportingMode

VATEntry.Notes =
       if Invoice.VATNotes.HasValue, then VATEntry.Notes = Invoice.VATNotes
       else if  Entry.EnterpriseCompany is Bulgaria, then VATEntry.Notes = "Продажба на стоки/услуги."

```


> [!NOTE]
> RegistrationVATNumber, RegistrationNumber And VATNotes **can** be null if there is no value for them.
